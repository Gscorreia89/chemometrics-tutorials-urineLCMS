    "It is worth noting that a selection procedure of this kind is also a type of multiple testing, and it is recommended to apply false discovery rate or any other multiple testing correction to the *p-values* obtained in this manner. Also, formal inferential procedures to derive *p-values* and confidence intervals are not established for PLS models. Although *ad-hoc* solutions like a permutation test can be implemented as shown, some issues still remain - for example, the *p-value* distribution obtained for the regression coefficients is clearly non-uniform and care must be exercised when performing multiple testing correction or even interpreting the *p-values* obtained in this manner.\n",

    "The latent variable and dimensionality reduction provided by PLS/PLS-DA can be very usefull to visualize general trends in the data. However, interpreting which variables are important to the model and how they contribute for the explanation/separation between classes is not easy. We suggest complementing the inspection of multivariate model parameters with univariate analysis."
